<h2> An Overview of Social Influence </h2>

<p> This school year I joined the Pstuychology club and have learned a lot about psychology, especially social psychology, which deals with how we think and behave in certain social situations.  One area of social phsychology is social influence.  Social influence focuses on how individuals can change the thinking and behavior of others.  Conformity is one form of social influence and is used in regards to when individuals act in a certain way, even if it goes against their own moral judgements or their own usual behavior, in order to fit in with others.  Obedience is another form in which people submit to a figure of authority. </p>

<h2> The Solomon Asch Experiment </h2>
        
<p> The Solomon Asch experiment was a study conducted in the 1950s, which focusd on conformity.  Participants were brought to a table with other people, which they believed to be subjects as well.  Instead those other people were only stooges pretending to be subjects.  Everyone at the table was asked which line on a board was the same as the given target/standard line.  The asnwer to this question was unambigious and clear; however, the people who were acting as participants were told to give the wrong answer.  The researches were testing if the test subject would go along with the others and give the incorrect answer as well or stray away from the group and give the correct answer.  The results showed that the subjects went along with the group in giving an incorrect answer for 37% of the trial runs.  Their reasons for doing so varied between normative and informational influence; knowing they are right versus doubting their own selves about being correct.  This experiment exhibited group conformity in action,  The resuts may have reflected the times in regards to McCarthyism and other political beliefs. </p>

<h2> The Miligram Experiment</h2>

<p> In 1963, Stanley Miligram conducted a study, focusing on obedience, with 40 male subjects.  Each trial consisted of two people.  The subject was given the role of "teacher" and the actor, who the subject thought was also a subject, was given the role of "learner".  The "learner" was strapped into an electric chair, which the subject did not know was actually fake.  The "teacher" read out a bunch of word pairs that the "learner" had to memorize.  Afterward the subject had to read out one of the words in the pair, and the "learner" had to give the correct word pair.  For each incorrect word pair said, the "teacher" had to increase the voltage on the chair by 15 volts.  With each "shock", the actor screamed in order to make it seem like he was actually in pain.  If the subjects wanted to stop, they were pressed to move foward with the experiment by a person in a lab coat, which was meant to be seen as an authority figure.  65% of the subjects kept going on with the experiment until the maximum voltage of 450 volts.  This study exhibits the concept of obedience in action.  This may connect with how many of the Nazis after World War 2 said that they were only following orders and not participating in genocide out of their own voilition. </p>
